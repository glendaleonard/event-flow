# Event-flow

This repository contains the codebase for the article ''Event Flow - How Events Shaped the Flow of the News, 1950-1995'', published at the 2nd Computational Humanities Research Conference. 

## Abstract
This article relies on information-theoretic measures to examine how events  impacted the news flow for the period 1950-1995. Moreover, we present a method for event characterization in (unstructured) textual sources, offering a taxonomy of events based on the different ways they impacted the flow of news information. The results give us a better understanding of the relationship between events and their impact on news sources with varying ideological backgrounds.
